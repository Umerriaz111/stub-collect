## Issues Found & Resolved

### Issue 1: Rate Limiter Import
- **Problem:** Initial concern about Flask-Limiter integration
- **Resolution:** Flask-Limiter already installed and working correctly
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 2: Duplicate CORS Configuration
- **Problem:** Separate CORS rules for stubs and marketplace
- **Resolution:** Consolidated to single `/api/*` rule for all API endpoints
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 3: SQLite Migration Constraints
- **Problem:** Named foreign key constraints causing batch operation issues
- **Resolution:** Added explicit constraint names to all foreign keys
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 4: Database Migration Conflicts
- **Problem:** Multiple database files and cached model definitions
- **Resolution:** Cleared all database files and Python cache, used db.create_all()
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 5: CRITICAL - Duplicate Rate Limiter in stubs.py
- **Problem:** stubs.py was still creating its own rate limiter instance
- **Resolution:** Removed duplicate limiter, imported consolidated limiter from app
