## Issues Found & Resolved

### Issue 1: Rate Limiter Import
- **Problem:** Initial concern about Flask-Limiter integration
- **Resolution:** Flask-Limiter already installed and working correctly
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 2: Duplicate CORS Configuration
- **Problem:** Separate CORS rules for stubs and marketplace
- **Resolution:** Consolidated to single `/api/*` rule for all API endpoints
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 3: SQLite Migration Constraints
- **Problem:** Named foreign key constraints causing batch operation issues
- **Resolution:** Added explicit constraint names to all foreign keys
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 4: Database Migration Conflicts
- **Problem:** Multiple database files and cached model definitions
- **Resolution:** Cleared all database files and Python cache, used db.create_all()
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 5: CRITICAL - Duplicate Rate Limiter in stubs.py
- **Problem:** stubs.py was still creating its own rate limiter instance
- **Resolution:** Removed duplicate limiter, imported consolidated limiter from app
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved - December 2024

### Issue 6: CRITICAL - StubOrder.sync_with_listing_status() AttributeError
- **Problem:** Method accessed `self.stub_listing.status` without checking if relationship was loaded
- **Resolution:** Added defensive checks to load listing if relationship is None
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved - December 2024

### Issue 7: CRITICAL - StubListing.can_be_purchased() AttributeError  
- **Problem:** Method accessed `self.seller.can_accept_payments()` without checking if relationship was loaded
- **Resolution:** Added defensive checks to load seller if relationship is None
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved - December 2024

### Issue 8: CRITICAL - Transaction Consistency in DirectChargesService
- **Problem:** Stripe PaymentIntent created inside database transaction, causing potential inconsistency if database fails after Stripe succeeds
- **Resolution:** Moved Stripe API call outside transaction with proper cleanup on failure
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved - December 2024

### Issue 9: User.can_accept_payments() Returning None
- **Problem:** Method returned None instead of False when stripe_account_id was None
- **Resolution:** Wrapped return statement with bool() to ensure boolean return type
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved - December 2024

### Issue 10: CRITICAL - JSON Serialization Bug in to_dict() Methods
- **Problem:** StubOrder.to_dict() and StubPayment.to_dict() called .isoformat() on None datetime values
- **Resolution:** Added null checks for created_at and updated_at fields before calling isoformat()
- **Impact:** Would cause runtime errors when serializing unsaved model instances
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved - December 2024
